Othello README

Handin: This is my final handin.

Overview:

My Othello game has thirteen classes: App, Board, ComputerPlayer, Constants, Controls, Game, HumanPlayer, Move,
 Othello Square, Pane Organizer, Piece, Player and Referee which interact in the following ways:

-Game is my high level game class that starts the Game
-The Player interface is used to help establish that the HumanPlayer and ComputerPlayers are both players
-The Referee class has association to the two players, and is in charge of checking for sandwiches and valid
moves and switching the current player (making sure the game is actually run)
-The Human Player class contains a click handler and is used when a human player is playing to get mouse moves
-The Computer Player class contains a MiniMax method that determines the best move for the computer
-The Othello Square class creates squares that pieces can be added to
-The Board class creates a Board of Othello Squares
-The Piece class creates a Circle and sets it to a radius and color
-The PaneOrganizer class sets up the pain which contains the Othello Board and the Controls Pane
-The app class runs the game


Design Choices:

I chose to use a Player interface so that the Human and Computer players can have a lot of the same functions.
My Player interface only has a moveOver method which plays the turn for the respective players. I chose to
delegate a lot of the functions to my Referee class such as checking for sandwiches and flipping pieces. Both the
Human and the Computer Players have references to the Referee class and are therefore able to check for sandwiches/
valid moves and flip the pieces. It made sense to me to have the timeline in the Referee class so that it can create moves
and switches players for both the computer and the human players. I created a copy constructor in my Board class so
the MiniMax method can make moves only logically on the copy board in order to determine the best move. My Board class
is made up of an array of Othello Squares which can have pieces added to them.

Known Bugs: My Current Player and Score Labels don't update correctly
